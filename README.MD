We initiated fastpose to be an open source library that can perform a 2D/3D pose estimation in real time on a CPU.
Our requisites indicate that the estimation should be performed on a regular RGB stream for a small number of individuals.
With the help of deep learning, we hoped to provide a robust solution compatible with a large variety of situations to satisfy
educational and entertainment purposes.
